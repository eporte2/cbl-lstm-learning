because sometimes they jump on the bed .
what do you need to do to make a little hole ?

oh it even has a hook on it .
in Texas .
okay .
what happens when you wake up after youre dead ?
oh where does the snow go when it melts ?
that way we share the driving .

I dont think Im going to tell them something .
that was funny .
hey dont throw it at the plants .
by throwing it too hard it landed wrong .
on Daddys desk .
you did ?
not tonight Abe .
Mommy hawks could hold onto vines with their claws .
hawks could come to school and pick me up .
no Mommy just made the hook .
I dont know Abe .
have you and Daddy been watching cartoons ?
I dont think Im going to tell them anything .
you might hurt them .
did you use your flashlight to see where you were going ?
where do you think it might go ?
it landed wrong .
we are glad to greet you ?
oh .
oh you put the hook on after found it .
what do you think happens ?
yeah you can have it .
a what ?
except theyre not at school .
they dont cry .
Tarzan the monkey man .
what are you doing ?
how come ?
why each day I need to eat my fruit ?
theyre just at camping .
where where where the birds to .
you cant hear them .
yeah last day when you were at work we did .
swings on a rubberband .
I was a tiny seed .
I dont know .
because .
no .
what would you do if a hawk came to school to pick you up ?
Mommy did .
come here for just a second .
but they might .
did you carry some garbage out by yourself ?
maybe we could have some ice cream .
so when are you going to be a tiny seed ?
maybe if you wake up after youre dead .
does it go where the birds do when they leave ?
you did ?
fruit is so good for you .
yesterday ?
Im looking through this .
pop goes the rubberband .
maybe we could have some ice cream .
hey youre not supposed to throw books .
Im just not sure what happens .
beside that it tastes good .
its not time yet .
Im looking Im looking in this .
Abe I was already a tiny seed once .
I want the part that isnt taped .
down goes the monkey man .
are you sure ?
laugh .
oh could you reach the dumpster ?
we haveto wait until its time .
whatd everybody else say ?
what are you looking for ?
later on .
did you see that ?
Im gonna go now .
what are you making ?
I want to cut the tape off .
Mommy why are mice afraid of mice traps ?
I cant be one again can I ?
well what happens to it when it melts .
I want some ice cream .
I dont know .
no I tried .
one of these things .
are you gonna come with me ?
theyd say .
Im just looking in this .
maybe later on okay ?
then the hook will fall off .
uhhuh there you go .
what a klutzy Tarzan .
look what shape did you make ?
could you tell me ?
why is what made outof mice traps ?
what is that ?
Daddy help me get my cards out .
if you want to you can read that to Daddy .
I want some now .
its six thirty .
you did it that time .
what a klutzy man .
water melts it .
and I would say .
and were going to play softball at seven .
are you going to be a tiny seed again ?
get your coat .
Daddy know what I could do ?
why are mice afraid of mice traps ?
water makes the snow melt ?
okay Mommy .
just a second .
Tarzan the monkey man swings on a rubberband .
uh after after I grow big then I will .
look this is fixed now .
its a hawk .
oh because people use mice traps to get mice .
are you sure ?
Mommy watch youre missing .
just tell him .
yeah .
okay go get some things and put them on here and sing the song .
see ?
yeah yeah .
pop goes the rubberband .
okay where are your scissors at ?
Ann .
oh Im gonna be so lonely .
these are nightmares .
and I throw it .
because people are seeds .
does the snow turn into water ?
its a onion .
oh Im watching .
down goes the monkey man .
really ?
because mice are a little nuisance .
no Lovey would be here with you .
thats pretty clever .
your heads not paper .
thats neat .
then they get old .
know why hawks baby hawks are afraid of mousetraps ?
Daddy I found a hook .
right here .
snow doesnt turn into water ?
oh thats good news .
and Ill guess the answer .
I dont care to .
maybe I can draw on your face .
dont mess up my cards .
that looks like a nightmare alright .
and then they get to be tiny seeds again .
this could be an anteaters tongue too .
or its a part of a table .
Daddy likes them though .
I dont see them .
Im not .
why ?
it looks like paper .
how can you tell the difference between your cards and Daddys cards ?
because each time a hawk sees a hawk trap it tries to eat the stuff in in the hawk trap .
do they grow little first ?
except why do you call it a nightmare Mom ?
maybe I lost them .
or an anteaters tongue .
do you wanna eat it on your taco ?
no .
only ice turns into water ?
huh ?
you could use Mommys scissors .
yeah it looks like paper .
tell me which one is different .
dont get me with that .
do old people grow little .
remember what I told you ?
I have something thatll work .
you cant draw on it .
sure thankyou pardner .
Im not a ant pretend Daddys a ant .
where does the snow go again ?
or do they just turn into seeds ?
do you know ?
Daddy you could draw on your own face .
tell me what you remember .
a knife a magic knife .
huh ?
this one is different .
you know what ?
here comes the anteater .
they grow tiny and tiny and tiny .
I forgot where the snow goes .
yeah .
no I cant .
because it only has one block .
I know a different way to eat flower sunflower seeds .
if you hit me on the head Ill get you .
all by himself ?
what color is the taco meat ?
and tell me why he has a pointy um tail okay ?
why ?
and then they are so tiny .
if its your own face you could draw on it .
yeah .
maybe we can get you one for your birthday .
brown .
when the snow gets there what do the birds do ?
but this one is different .
how ?
they are tiny seeds .
I will smash your tongue .
after its cooked .
you get your mouth .
before we cook it its red .
because it has a colored block .
oh Abe people dont turn back into seeds .
why would I want to do that ?
here you go .
a toy ?
and these are all wooden .
they fly this way .
why are these things on his tail ?
then you start chewing .
what kind of toy ?
they grow from seeds .
can I look ?
not always .
oh they come back here ?
is it ?
its for big boys too .
nightmares are just bad dreams is that real ?
which answers right ?
can I see ?
but they dont turn back into seeds okay ?
was Mommy at work early ?
yeah .
oh .
oh I dont like to draw on faces .
and I dont wanna put this in my tacos .
I made one hole in the garden and one in the grass see ?
how come ?
is it dry ?
all of these are puzzle shapes .
okay do you want to see if it works ?
Daddy hand me the scissors the sharp scissors .
maybe we could get you a smaller one thats like it .
because they dont like snow .
I do .
yeah .
yeah they do .
its his imagination isnt it ?
what are those ?
oh I see .
except you need to go outside to try it .
or late ?
what are you going to use this on ?
tomatoes .
I think its real though .
gee thats interesting .
no they dont .
because its not a puzzle piece .
okay .
yeah .
remember when we grew tomatoes in our garden Abe ?
uhhuh come back in you need your shoes on to go outside .
I wont see ?
so when the snow goes there the birds come back here ?
is it ?
which one ?
look at this .
we can try in here watch .
why dont you tell me what happened when we went camping yesterday ?
you did it .
pretty clever .
yeah because Ann has a face like that .
can I see ?
where did you get this bow and arrow ?
yeah before it snowed we did .
lets put it all together now .
except my name came off .
how come ?
Im gonna try it in your chair .
give it to Mom .
yeah late last night it was the joker .
oh put my shoes on then I will show you .
you did it Dad .
because because because hawks are in danger .
no it didnt .
and when the snow comes back here the birds go back there ?
go ahead .
uhhuh last summer .
Im gonna throw it .
its at the very top of each of them .
Im gonna try it in your chair Dad .
yeah ?
I dont know how .
hawks are in danger ?
what is a joker ?
when you when hawks see a pencil and a knife they get scared .
did you ever eat any of them ?
I can see it from here .
thats a hard puzzle isnt it ?
Abe I wanna ask you something .
know what else you can use it for ?
okay .
right .
I dont know .
it was the card you saw that you liked so much .
I eated one bite of tomato .
she just sits around ?
know what ?
where was that ?
except why did you color on it ?
except Im looking at this right now .
okay you tell me what you remember .
yeah I need some help .
what does that mean ?
I think birds are pretty smart .
that one by country club .
they were good werent they ?
what ?
and when you get one like that they start to run .
okay lets figure out the easiest way to do it .
so it would look like an airplane .
okay .
to rake the ground in the garden smooth .
and then Ill tell you what I remember .
hey Abe do you want a flower ?
what do you think ?
did you tell Daddy what we saw sitting inside the library ?
today I can have hot chocolate for breakfast .
the toy store ?
dont leave them sitting here .
I said .
yeah we went to big apples too .
it should be a airplane .
yeah pretty smart .
aw I almost got your cards .
I cant remember .
you can grow your own flower .
I thought they were good .
oh .
I love hot chocolate .
that means danger .
okay first of all we drove out into the country .
why ?
big apple ?
do you mean that tomorrow morning you want hot chocolate for breakfast ?
a dog .
so we need to get one a really mean hawk .
uhhuh .
it is an airplane .
do you have a map ?
no some of it didnt go on very smoothly .
what did we get at Applebaums ?
that looks like a fun game .
put the large triangle in first .
am I a hawk ?
do you remember where we drove ?
come here let me show you how to hold it .
yeah on on my book a long long time ago .
and you can see their bones .

one thing about spears is that it should be carried real easy .
I undid it .
yeah Dad where were you today ?

they stick to the paper .
were you surprised to see that butterfly ?
what would happen to me if it didnt rain ?
empty paint jars arent very good to keep .
I undid the fan .
if they get lost .

why ?
I thought you wanted to .

the candy we took to the movie helps you grow .
whos older than me ?
lets see .

it is a poisonous snake .
if you want to try .
I cant make that one work .
you did ?
this is what the one I found looks like .
it was on the floor of the tent .

the heavier it goes the not farther it goes .
is this a antique cup ?
carried her up to the sky .
like a hawk ?
watch see ?

so we could find that kind of snake .
oh huh what did you do at the park today ?
yeah that would be a good size .
it fell on its noggin .
how come ?
okay .
and the pilot was sitting here .
your arms crushed .
what if we took all our string ?
is that pretty fast ?
what was it ?
because I saw some little icky black mud .
except I forgot it .
of course .
Abes really going through a growth spurt .
I think it might be .
hey never drop this .
this is what I wanted to make .
I would fall down .
a canteen .
oh .
do babies try to learn how to talk .
it was dust .
yeah thats pretty fast .
then it would go up to the sky .
can I eat it now ?
you could break it .
wheres my plastic canteen ?
if I was a pilot I would probably get to sit there too right ?
how come ?
oh .
its falling again .
how come they got cars on them ?
hey I dont want any cheese .
Mom watch how fast I could run .
its too big to tie onto this stick .
a penny ?
because it would land on my head when it came down .
I didnt break it .
what did you do with it ?
the ScarletKing snake .
and I would say happy birthday to me .
or do they just learn without trying ?
how about half ?
it means your bodys growing .
wow .
whoops take off for Mars .
yeah you need to get gold and then a hammer .
those are just pictures .
you can eat a little .
you almost did .
Daddy would you like to set a trap for that snake ?
I dont know why .
tell Dad about the playground equipment .
okay then we could go way way way down from the stairs and dig for that rock I saw .

the Flintstones is on a cartoon show ?

now look what ChopWoods sharing with the prairie dog .
jam or jelly ?
because it would still be alright .
did Mom tell you that we dont think you should climb the volley ball pole anymore ?

I dont think so .
Mommy once I saw a person that shot a fire arrow .
maybe .
God thinks were ants .
I dont like the strawberry jam .
and the big hands on the five .

and theres another word for teetee teetee .
oh well the ladders taped on .

Abe .
we probably will .
WonderWoman .
yeah .
what ?
Mommy I put it right here .

thats what I said Mommy .
I hope we could go .

just as far as we went the first time ?
I would be real pissed off .
yeah like candy .
what would have happened if they hadnt invented houses ?
I dont ?
it was a good thing .
is Chris eating ?
uhhuh .
no a fox is only about this big .
I put it straight here .
maybe we will .
how will he know what I want all the way up there ?
why does the inside of it have meat ?
no hes watching tv .
good .
I thought you said that .
it was Shannons and Jasons .
I think she is .
huh ?
how come ?
Mom what if I went into school in the evening ?
if we go to Texas how much days would we stay there ?
yeah .
what are you doing ?
and as far as we went first time .
he cant run unless he makes a noise .
and she got a towel and got it on the hot part .
I dont think you could have since it spilled .
oh yeah .
I dont know .
yeah a fox couldnt attack a sheep .
why ?
can I lasso you legs ?
I didnt say it .
do you want to put it by the candy ?
I think wed haveto live in log cabins then .
because I stuffed it with meat .
I dont think Chris knows where Jason lives .
what do you mean ?
the duster ?
why does he make a noise ?
youll haveto write a letter and tell him to bring our gifts here instead of to Texas .
you must have said it .
you can try to tie them up if you want to .
oh you almost didnt go today did you ?
but a coyote could .
not many a couple weeks at most .
the first time that we went there as far as when we had a picnic last night .
do you think wed be very comfortable ?
what are you going to use it on ?
because he wants he wants everyone to think he runs real fast hey .
right .
what was it ?
how about if I keep that one there ?
yeah even a dog a coyote would have no trouble attacking a dog either .
before we go before we go we better get the tickets .
no .
Im wiping it up .
well would we stay for Christmas ?
Chris and one of his friends and Mista .
yeah we could use infinitylogs to build it .
why dont you tell Daddy why ?
what have you been doing all day ?
the tv .
I didnt take them apart .
Mom are you gonna be a nurse ?
I dont think Chris knows where Amara lives oh .
hey Mom the feathers .
uhuh were probably going to rent a cabin for some days .
huh ?
right .
I just cut the top off and took the insides out .
thats right .
oh Abes going to go in the seventeenth for his physical .

Ill show you .
this is for you Daddy .

a metal dog wouldnt .
because wed all be at school at different times .

I was going like this .
well is there such a thing as a painted feather ?
Dad there really were animal tracks there .

Mom was going like this .
why not ?
do you want me to go to the basketball game tonight ?
what were you going to do instead ?
thanks .
oh yeah Id say invisible if I couldnt see something .
what ?
how ?
because I would haveto help all those patients .
it could be a dangerous animal Dad .
no Im going to have some more stew .
not even a real dog .
you need to write him a letter .
if I couldnt go to school I was gonna do my schoolwork at home .
Mommy how long are we going to the lake ?
it looks like he got surprised .
oh its cold there all the time huh ?
because it could fight back .
do you mean its a real one ?
yeah I see that .
why do you think they cant mail them ?
what do you think we would have done last night if a dangerous animal had chased us ?
oh .
why ?
and then everybody would say .
it looks like he got scalped .
heres the hay .
I dont even know what I want .
Dad this is the way that I learned how to tie in school .
she should be more careful right ?

what if we dont let them be friends yet ?
its up to you .
then we could buy some good apples .
lets pretend they didnt become friends yet .
we could buy some cut apples .
I wanna pretend they didnt even meet .
or we could buy some bread that isnt cut .
I like the ones that are cut best .
wheres his horse ?
you could see his teeth .
you know why ?
why would they do that ?
because you dont haveto cut it .
oh .
we could buy it at TomThumb first .
why ?
oh even though he was knocked unconscious .
because its running outof bread .
theyre running outof bread .

and well try another store .
Dad didnt it surprise you when you came home ?
Abe was surprised too .
