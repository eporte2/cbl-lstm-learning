oh dear .
oh you could buy some catfood for stripy couldnt you ?
yes .
instead of going to the pantomime we went to see that .
what is it then ?
what about it ?
is it ?
were not playing at banging anything .
hello Pat .
and hes got a fish sticking in him .
thats two .
oh well I dont serve snake in my shop .
in which case I dont need to build up Pingus igloo do I ?
Ive got two again but Ive only gone that far havent I ?
so youve just given me any old letter have you ?
why cant come out and have look at it ?
were pretending its a what ?
shes jumped into the river has she ?
I wearing these shorts .
well why are you doing that ?
when you took my pond off me .
there we are .
that man driving the tractor is the vet .
no .
two pounds in money ?
I could .
two cameras .
you want that on the top do you ?
I am fixing it .
it was a magic story wasnt it about the jungle and about the animals .
you cant shoot my eggs .
and hes got some weed on him aswell .
what do you think it is ?
you tell me .
theres the ramp .
no .
no .
that one .
you could .
can you rescue her quickly please Aran and bring her back here ?
I putting the soap on him .
seems a little expensive to me .
thats too dangerous .
you can get out and have a look at it if you want to .
youre not wearing your shorts yet are you ?
well I think brute force isnt quite the answer is it ?
oh heres a picture of me isnt it ?
two dolls .
is Terence going to climb up the ramp ?
you cried .
you you give it to me .
oh well he can thats fine isnt it ?
there it is .
youve youve not tidied up all these vegetables .
who built it ?
right .
you got .
cut it .
two clowns .
yes .
come on .
do bear in mind that Mummy doesnt build very strong bridges darling .
I think I can get cheaper than that at Sainsburys .
when you land on a snake you gotto go down .
there it is .
far too dangerous .
well I should imagine one of the other little boys built it .
and does the soap hurt him ?
I cried when Mummy took my pond off me last week .
youve gotto say to me what are you doing ?
no .
put him through the carwash .
why ?
and what was the tiger name called ?
is this Poppy the cat or is this Stripy ?
no .
gosh .
cut it .
I will shoot them again .
so how many have I got ?
no .
because he can get outof the tractor and have a look at Dapple .
youve gotto come and buy it off me .
but you just never do do you ?
this is dusty Aran .
those are mine .
no .
dont you think youd be a bit better with a bit of mechanical expertise .
yeah .
youve gotto put him further forward .
well youll haveto do the cutting yourself Im afraid .
no .
thats a very big bar of soap Aran .
well youve not given Dyllis much have you ?
where the other where the others gone ?
well he was just called tiger wasnt he ?
um I flying .
Ive collected those .
and if you start to press it very hard it will break just like that .
thats Stripy .
youre not shooting anything until youve tidied up the vegetables .
theres your shopping basket .
because that man fills it up for us doesnt he ?
because we havent been playing with it have we ?
what shall we pretend it is ?
flying across ceiling .
come on .
now youre just being silly again now arent you ?
last week ?
thats right .
thats Stripy is it ?
cant he ?
Im not cutting it .
you spin this .
has somebody eaten them ?
but Im afraid this shop isnt open for service until weve got it organized .
youve taken it all to Bella .
it was this morning that .
hm ?
I think hes a bit too thin actually .
oh hello Pat .
and then he can get back in and drive the tractor .
dont say that again .
hm ?
and what was .
how much space is there in Pingus igloo ?
I got two .
chop chop .
how do you know its Stripy ?
yeah .
are you sure its a bar of soap ?
Im just painting my ceiling today but its very difficult because I cant reach .
what do you think it is ?
come on .
do you not press Daddys bridges as hard or does he build stronger ones ?
well I thought he was going through the carwash .
he was just like that wasnt he ?
whatre you going to do about it Misterdeliveryman ?
well thats the eggs then .
oh have you fallen down dead from eating a poisonous snake ?
so Mummy doesnt haveto get out either .
never mind .
I will .
I dont think you actually did do the spinning then did you ?
not again .
lets tie dollys hair up again .
hes a sports car .
you get all those vegetables and bring them over here .
well you havent got them in pairs have you ?
I think its a castle .
I think well haveto turn to yellow .
yeah .
and can you put the top on them ?
is it ?
a tiger .
I dont think Dapples seriously hurt is he ?
she likes to eat pigs ?
because its not a self service petrol station is it ?
oh now dont throw it about .
hm ?
right well is this tractor fixed then ?
right .
this is going in the truck .
where are the rest of the cans ?
make her beautiful again .
grr .
he has got some fish hasnt he ?
a castle .
is he nice and dry and clean and fresh now ?
no .
this the tiger .
I think thats a bit unlikely .
well if Terence could come down the ramp .
oh well if youve got two .
we dont seem to have many blue and white blocks do we ?
dont you think youd better use one of these smaller ones as a bar of soap .
you havent got the ones that fit together .
can you ?
dont .
I think I I think I built it .
I dont .
it wont matter .
this is going in the truck .
he does .
no .
over there .
dont .
well break him .
if I was asked nicely I might but until I am .
does Stripy like fish ?
it wont matter .
you think that tin of paints empty .
well you wouldnt like to tell me how he des it would you ?
how does dolly .
why not ?
right .
come on then .
look .
no .
you think you built it did you ?
yes .
and show me how they all go together .
oh .
well you pick them up .
youve been caught fighting with that little boy so youve gotto come down that snake onto that one havent you ?
yes .
either we play with this or we put it away .
we wont .
hes not as good as the other cars is he ?
dont squeeze dollys nose or else she wont be able to breathe .
so even more freight for the railway .
shall we put it on here ?
right .
why not ?
and its Bennys turn .
well Im not sure Pat .
be nice to him .
you see Ive got two apples .
are we going to have a smokestack on it ?

its only a trick .
what does poppy like ?
yes .
oh hes been kissed better by the vet has he ?
I dont want you to .
Im not sure about that Aran .
yes please .
its Bennys turn ?
there was a tunnel wasnt there in the ground that they all went down to hide .
its easier if you put it on here isnt it ?
is it going on a long journey ?
I got two .
oh right .
you be very careful with it .
right .
I thought you said he was running away from home though .
well go on then .
you like chips ?
because .
I thought he was going to say thankyou to Benny for being so kind as to rescue him and saving his life .
I go push the mat in .
oh .
