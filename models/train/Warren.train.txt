and look at all the steam coming outof their funnels .
we havent really got anything to use as a blanket unless unless we use the dolls dress or blouse .
undo my braces .
shes cold .
one two three .
xxx mine .
because I think you want to play with Annas train .

there was one posted through the fireguard and Daddys found it again .

and that delicious pie .
oh yes .
oh dear .
youve got alotof shopping there havent you ?
dont throw it in .
its gone round a corner hasnt it ?
pumpy pumpy pumpy .
theyre really having to puff hard to get up that hill .
because if you have a boat at he seaside you need to have a special vehicle that can pull it down so it can get into the sea .
shall I put some more tea in the cup ?
wear this .
and with Annas doll and with her other toys .
yes .
thats the wrong side mate .
put it in carefully .

Warrens nappies falling down .
those two blue ones .

um Mummy go on the motorway .
so can you find a piece of puzzle thats got flashing lights on .
and if Daddy comes in you cant play with them .
theres the red cup .
right .
your nappies falling down ?
could do .
the page is stuck .
I go go tip it all out .
well shall we put this stuff away first ?
you could make a pattern with your stars couldnt you ?
lets put her blouse on underneath then .
yes .
it does .
can I have the money please ?
whatever pumpy pumpy pumpying is .
we could line them all up .
here you are .
theres the red cup .
you can take them out if youre careful .
we went on the motorway yesterday didnt we ?
the page is .
I think that piece you put in before must be wrong .
well .
divided into three pieces because there are three pieces .
a nice cup of tea .
dont take your trousers off .
theres the money .
Im worn out .
put her arms in .
here they are at the next station .

wheres my pocket gone ?
we went on the motorway yesterday to Sainsburys .
I need the LandRover .
youre going on holiday with your basket ?
come on .
no no no .
Mummy make .
but I think before you get your dumper truck out you oughtto put your tea set away because you might damage it .
theres the banana cake .
hes got his pajamas .
and they were a present from Dick and Wendy .
oh you havent got pockets because you had to change your trousers didnt you ?
and whats he wearing ?
well you look for her pants .
there .
I dont know where the little boat is .
dont tip that out .
I think the trousers are a good idea because its a bit cold outside isnt it ?
your nappies not falling down pet .
come on .
have they woken up now ?
I think that one goes in another puzzle .
because the other two pieces have been taken away .
thats right .
not quite as exciting .
thats it .
I did .
I want Daddy .
whatre you taking with you in your basket ?
top hat .

I want Daddy .
that bits been eaten by somebody I think .
youve gotto try and find a piece that goes here .
that goes there .
so its its red .

it is not red a blue .
because the day before James had blown steam at him and got the top hat wet .
