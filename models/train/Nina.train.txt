werent they .
maybe she would like some tea .
or those were penguins .
oh I think the sheep are probably getting hungry .
a spoon and a knife .

do you think she would like some tea after her bath ?
and then she gave it to me .
those were the penguins .
oh .
have you ever been in an elevator ?
lets put her very carefully here .
she we should keep her in this box .
the seals were swimming in the water I think .
and the cow would like some grass .
and a fork .
because you have a doll carriage already .
she would like some tea now that this dolly doesnt need a bath .
and thats how we do it you know ?
I think shes going in a elevator .
but you can take her out and give her some tea if you want .
