thats not you .
its the toilet .
and they were all looking and all .
they used to be in the kitchen right enough .
did you know that youre a clever girl being able to do that ?
where did you go ?
or I could have fired the two of them out .
who is it ?
and not even bothering xxx .
no honestly and weve had two and a half years of her throwing bottles up on it .
Imean that fringe is cracking me up .
its worse when its your first .
are you going to school now ?
did you paddle in the water ?

maybe that was why you didnt see it .
shes going straight to the toilet .
wee tiny one or big one ?

I might stick one of her coats on him a nice pink one .

yeah yeah .
Kathryns constantly pulling the thing out yousee .
they got me down to the labor ward and got me onto the table when his head was coming out .
