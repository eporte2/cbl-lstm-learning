I could do it myself when you say .
that you were on the inside when it happened .
do you like those names ?

youre not going to love me right .
I want to turn it .
but hes not in my class .
Ross told me this morning that uh .

and he thinks hes a baby but hes not .
it means I love you .
I would want to read .
wait now one more .
uh huh .
whos a fool ?
and you know why youre not going to love me ?

yikes ababa .
a light bulb in the window ?
okay .
Ross can I ask you some more questions ?

you dont look like you used to .
and I said .
and what did they do ?
but its not a good word .
sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt .
no thats harder .

because only those that have shoes on can come in here .
a thing that you need for if you crash through .
did they shoot cross bows and have fun ?
he said .
even foolish .
your curls are out .
do you want to stay there ?
you know Dad I really made a mistake .
you really think you could make it through that door ?
you dont know what it is .
turn it a little bit more .
because when you have a sister you cant sleep with her when you get get older .
its not a good word to call anybody .
why does he like Boba Fett all much ?
you crash through the wall ?
no .
when I die Ill still think of you and youll still be my little boy .
okay youve got two of them turned now one more .
dad you know where I put it ?

and what about the ceiling .
they mean their mind is going to live forever .
just tell me what kind of part .

okay no no no .
no no it doesnt mean sad .
yes .

how did he do it ?
you did it right too .
I dont know .
I just dont want no no no .

I put power in my bike too .
how did he win ?
he wont do it .

and I think its a nice idea too Ross .
Marky do you think you can make it through the cat door ?
we have two TwoOneBees weapons .
mom does this looked fixed ?
on the hinge .
what does that mean ?
yeah .
he wont get blocks .
can Marky put power in his bike too ?
two I mean three ObiWanKanobi .
is it comfy ?
and then you wont be able to close it .
yeah .
now do you want to do a real hard one ?
its in there back to there .
that your mind can live forever .
your Smurf shirt is dirty and we can wash it tomorrow .
yes it does .
what does it mean ?
you can go get books .
do you want some French toast ?
and so do you need one ?
no dont tell me why tell me how .
no ?
it might be true too .
Ross can Marky put power in his too ?
right so she can see the name .
not books blocks .
you wont be able to close it any more right .
no Im not going to do it because sometimes you guys dont tell the truth .
okay everybody were going to try and make it through the cat door .
I tricked you .
yeah .
cartoons and why are they good ?
that shows true .
do that .
no Daddy .
one DarthVader lightsabers and one more one more Luke Skywalker lightsaber .
what do you use it for ?
I want to tell you why .

I know .
no no your promise is that youre going to get those blocks back .
I got Pepsi .

Im the one who Marky was sleep .
because he has a home he doesnt haveto go in here .

I want another taste .
it is important for him to eat his lunch and to be sociable at preschool .

how do you know that he wasnt really in the first bunch how do do you know that he wasnt part of the first bunch ?
oh I see .
whod you warn ?
the demon the demon is pretending to be a old lady .
well the old one is traditional .
what does it say ?
only if you eat meat .
first the first the Wompas come out Luke off the Tauntaun and then he smacks the Tauntaun .
did you learn how to do it then ?
would you like to be her boy ?
well but then youll know that violence is bad .
both .
that means that people have been doing it for a long time .
yeah move the guy up right no just one step unless you you want to jump you could jump this guy and move here .
then what would you do ?
yeah maybe even some words that you .
r two escapes .
what ?

dont you think that that was wrong was a mistake ?
toy .
from the slump .
uhhuh .
umhum .
you say eat my friend ?
and then they do the dance .
yeah you have meat in your body .
and maybe theres some words that you know that Mommy doesnt know .
and so its hard to change .
well just go hide it in a place somewhere where no one will will find it .
it it it crushed some snow from from up down to the rebel base .
oh I see .
does he ever smack Han off the Tauntaun ?
hmhunh .

good Ross .
but how can you warn me unless you tell me ?
cause its important to learn about war .
at first I thought he was in the middle now I know thats hes the last one of the first .

umhum .
umhum .
uhuh .

and then another cowboy said .
I mean like that thing that youre nextto that youre looking in right now that big box .
whats the best job to have ?

umhum okay ?
so who cares .
what should that be ?
then I should tell you beforehand ?
some days they would keep as many as thirty seven trucks busy .
the funnest job the most fun job is feeding the fish because you know why ?
oh Ive got a idea .
so what did they do to him ?
yeah .
isnt that right ?
okay every time you go to a party with kids .
would you like to put that away ?
really .

did they take him away theyre not going to hurt him ?
even if she uses that kind of shampoos that doesnt work I still like her I still like the look of her I still do .
we can put that away if you like .
I see .
good .
listen let me tell the whole rules .
but is there anything interesting about it Ross ?
he was addressing to Mark and telling him .
good .
Abbott said he might still drink on the dead man and then the the sheriff said .
he was work he was he he was gave um he was giving ah Michael Knight to get right to gain .
do you want to put that away ?
daddy why did you put this upside down ?
it has little things in it .
Ill tell you the whole deal .
no .
well how ?
theyre just sugar .
is that right ?
I wont do it .
why did you gun by him .
and also when he was in the shower he said he dropped his soap .

go brush your teeth .
this soap is so slippery .
what what are they ?
I think I just dropped a bottle on my head .

when you go to school you haveto be nice to all the kids at school .
I think youve got the wrong idea Ross .
yeah the the one the ones that they ad .
I dont understand do you understand ?
I want blanket and then brush teeth .
I sure hope Todd and his family dont get here too late and miss it .

then you want to be mean to other people .
hm .

that might work .
okay you can have a little blanket servant .
did people come in your room ?

very sneaky Mark .
well Daddy I want to tell you .

a Mina bird .
I gotta get I gotta get another kid I gotta get my teddy bear and then get another and then Id get my teddy bear and put it on the ground laying it down and I would run behind them and trip him so he would wait for me so he would wait for nothing and then just fall down .
yes .
but Im the one that has glasses .
will you help with this ?
this is the boy Gelfling and this is the girl Gelfling I got it wrong .
my turn now .
yeah ?
because Im busy .
Im going to go like this .
you mean if you have a candy heart youll be good .
and I picked a blanket outof here .
hey you cant jump me .
why is this the girl Gelfling why is this the boy ?
what happened here ?
I can .
and too bad if if you have a candy heart you know why ?
what ?
usually yeah they do .
maybe it felled .
ready ?
I said .
maybe it fell maybe .
because I keep the crystal in the back of him .
those are Rossys .
why ?
you keep Rossys and you keep mine .
because the Grogg in Raggedy Ann will eat your heart .
because I was real busy and no one was there .
maybe a ghost knocked it off .
right and everybody knows that the boy .
Ive gotto jump you now .
it was Sunday and not very many people work on Sunday .
oh very bad boy .
the Grogg in Raggedy Ann ?
no stop .
glug .
yeah very sneaky .
good .
good Marky good .
now if your brother falls and you have a warm heart then youll go and youll help him .
and why why is why does that mean that hes a boy ?
then maybe I would um push him out the door and lock everything .
no you cant do that Ross .
oh .
he really is doing well isnt he ?
most most people stay home and play with their kids .
after you jump you move and you haveto jump again if you want want to move again .
when you were a little boy three years old there were were some things you could do better than what Marky can do now .
get me a Hand .
but I want to go to ChildrensPalace .
because the boy one has the crystal .
no nobodys home at Sunday .
you dont have a warm nice heart ?

oh a cart go faster .
because you hurt your foot .
yeah its a cool name .
what wouldnt you know ?
youknow it was a perfect use of it uh rhetorically .
I dont mean to hurt you but I haveto get those pricklies off and its the only way .
maybe theres an Indian there we didnt hear about .
oh I thought you said a car .
here try my xxx .
I wouldnt know if your mom and dad were still alive if you didnt tell me .
no I mean its so weird like .
see if that .
mhm .

thats pretty neat one .
I betcha because your moms dad used to live on the wild west .

that those were your parents .
in other words ro Mark didnt could use it rhetorically correctly but didnt haveto use it metaphorically .
