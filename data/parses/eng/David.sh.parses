he never phoned || so || he must || have || got || away
how || did || you do || that
everyday || at half five || xxx
good || so || he would || only || sleep || about || eleven || to || half eleven
she || says
and || I remember || sitting || out || here || and || xxx thinking
right
every || time || I went || into || the kitchen || and my kitchens bright || I hadto || put || the lights || on
all || I heard || was || that || you || had || a party
your || man || has || a backlog || in mortgages
and everything || was || Christmas
they || give || her || an extra spoonful || to make || sure || it worked
but || isnt || this || great || the way || you || come || in || here || to || the kitchen || and || youve somewhere || to eat || and || a || room || for living || in
a wee computer || thing || we || got || him
youve || everything || done
thats || very interesting || David
Im || not || gonna || make || it || back || and all || and walking
people || were definitely buying their || Christmas stuff || big boxes || outof Leisureworld
and || you || know || thats right
whoever || hes || getting || his mortgage || from || he has || a backlog || xxx
well || thats || okay
and || he learned || how || to spell || right
tell Cathy || what || you got || for || your birthday
who || did || that
heres || me flip
so || that || doesnt || really disrupt || anything
