cried || the army

okay || I got an idea || this week || what || we || can || do
maybe || when
Im || not || the frog || who || cant || sing

snoopy Come Home

hot || shot
Markys || going to be dead

thats || okay || Ross
yeah
good
but || what about || when || you wore || your underoos

here || I am || sitting || on || the floor || and || I dont || have || a blanket
the bull || did || not || have || a bullet
we || took || the new || ones || outof || another || tape recorder

Han steers straight
then || after || that

after || six || is
what || if || they || all || fit || in the DarthVader
funny
no || its || a good || way || of || saying || no || it isnt
cause || when || a person || is || really tired || you say
its || funny
what did || you do with || the batteries
five
because || everybody puts || some more || on || their || body
you dont || like marshmallows || huh

no || he didnt spit || you || out
cause
and they || dont take || guns
fighted
say || it loud
dead tired || means || youre || really tired
daddy || I need || you || for || these || shoes
and || I think || maybe || I || should poke || my eye || into || my fingers
miss Olsen
cause || Im gonna buy || all || the action figures
tell || me || why
oh || because || you were || too young
you should || have || said fought
just scraping
four
yeah || and || from dying || from || the rabies
cause || it was || real || different || like || a marshmallow || in || that || milk
miss Olsen || told || you || that
thats || too || silly
and they || dont shoot

three
just scraping
Ross repeat || it

isnt || that || pretty
just || like || Im going to sit || on || my || bed
yikes ababa
a light bulb || in the window
okay
Ross || can || I ask || you || some more questions
so
and || she || was || on || the || inside
he thinks || hes || a || baby
why
you want to fix || it || up
theres || a big stripped || thing
because || Im || a bad || father
oh || theres || a policeman || in front || of || us
no || thats the || the sunlight
preschool
I || do || everything || you say
lets || see || I said
and then || she || went || outside
yeah
I see
well || you || called || me
yeah
its || a || tiger || run
then || Ill || give || him || a gun
do || they || do || it every || day
you mean || up || in the closet || up || in the lamp
sure || watch
and || hes || not
what || is || a || bed
if || you || come || in || here || youre || going to get hurt
what || if || I had || a girl
okay || I wont || call || you || that || any more
okay || I got || it straight
what policeman
its || a || tiger || run
the white || part || goes || with || the white || part
and || when || did || Robin Hood || go || back || in the forest
maybe || that will || stop || his || crying
I || learn || it every || day || when || its || story || time || after lunch
a || thing || that || you || sleep || on
shucks || I thought || I had || that one || Mom
yeah
and || I started || to go || but || I knew || I couldnt || fit || through
assoonas || you finish || that one || Ill give || you || another one
or || something
Im sorry
okay
theres || no difference || if || you || come || in here
maybe || that || that will || be || a deal
and || he said
I said || you were || were foolish
what || is || a car
let || me ask || you || another question || if || I can
when || they were free
its || hard || to move || the middle || one || Ross
I || really || made || a mistake
good || Ross
well || it || wouldnt || be || as || much || fun
a thing || that || you drive || in
you can || help || me || pick || up || pieces || of wood || here
I didnt || say || you were || a fool
did || it || work
I finished || it
you dont || think || you can || fit || through || that || little || door
uh huh
do you know || what || what aluminum foil || is
do you like || your || preschool
I shouldnt || have gotten || that frisbee || for || you
and || what || is || a || wall
Ill bet || put || the sides || back || with || the middle
you dont || look || like || you used || to
and || I said
and || what did || they || do
but || its || not || a good || word
sometimes || it works || and || sometimes || it doesnt
no || thats harder
why
why
because || only || those || that || have || shoes || on || can || come || in here
a thing || that || you need || for || if || you crash || through
yeah
did || they || shoot cross bows || and || have fun
he said
even foolish
your curls || are || out
do you want to stay || there
you know || Dad || I || really || made || a mistake
you || really || think || you could || make || it || through || that || door
you dont know || what || it || is
turn || it || a little bit || more
because || when || you have || a sister || you cant || sleep || with || her || when || you get || get older
its || not || a good || word || to || call anybody
why || does || he || like Boba Fett || all || much
yeah
Markys || being || bad

yeah
do you know || what || the word || good || means
you mean || why || does || he || like Boba Fett || so || much

if || you made || a || house
hes || going to say || something
Mark

I made || a mistake || in letting || you || take || me || outof || that || old || preschool

Ross || youre || doing || that really || well
what does || the word || good || mean
well || what || do you use || it || for

you || did
okay || Ross || is || going to try || to go || in || through || the cat || door

they || mean || their || mind || is || going to live forever
just || tell me || what kind || of || part
no
okay || no || no || no
no || no || it doesnt || mean || sad
yes
you || did
because || it was || backwards

no || you dont || have || one || because || I looked || all || over || and || you didnt || have || one
how || did || he || do || it
you || did || it || right || too
I dont know
I just || dont || want || no || no || no
right here
yes || I || did
no || because || hes || not || down || here
it was backwards || and || she || couldnt || see || the name
very good
how || did || he || do || it
how about || if || I || say || it || is || a good || tv program
I || get || to do || a super hero || puzzle
oh || the hinge
what || if || you didnt || have || a ceiling
this is || going to be || the big experiment
its || a nice program || isnt || it
the || two || side || pieces || came || back

I wouldnt || do || that || without undies
do you want to use || his || pillow
thats || called || a hinge || Honey
I || put power || in || my bike || too
how || did || he win
he wont || do || it
yeah
I want another puzzle || Dad
yeah
what would || happen
didnt || they
and || so || what did || you do || now
and || I think || its || a nice || idea || too || Ross
Marky || do you think || you can || make || it || through || the cat || door
we || have || two TwoOneBees weapons
why || dont || you have any underpants || on
mom || does || this || looked || fixed
on || the hinge
Ill || tell || you || why || he || did || it || so || good
what does || that mean
yeah
yeah
he wont || get || blocks
can || Marky || put power || in || his bike || too
something || would || come || in
two || I mean || three ObiWanKanobi
is || it comfy
and then || you wont || be able || to close || it
yeah
now || do you want to do || a real || hard || one
its || in there || back || to || there
that || your mind || can || live forever
your Smurf || shirt || is || dirty || and || we || can || wash || it tomorrow
yes || it || does
what does || it || mean
you can || go || get || books
do you want some French toast
and || so || do you need || one
no || dont || tell me || why || tell me || how
well || its || not || fixed
no
it || might be || true || too
Ross || can || Marky || put power || in || his || too
right || so || she || can || see || the name
not || books || blocks
you wont || be able || to close || it || any more || right
no || Im || not || going to do || it || because || sometimes || you guys || dont || tell || the truth
okay || everybody || were || going to try || and || make || it || through || the cat || door
cartoons
okay
I tricked || you
yeah
cartoons || and || why || are || they || good
that shows || true

what || do you use || it || for
I want to tell || you || why
with || syrup || on || it
dad || you know || Marky || you get || over here
now || turn || that
I wish || the world || were || like || it || were || when || you were || a little baby
daddy || I cant || see || which || of these || Mommy taped
now || Mommy || wont || have any more || trouble
that shows || true || right
its || not || made || for || washing
Im going to put || your || tape recorder || down || here || because || at night || time || you usually || have || me || do || it
because || theyre || for || boys
not || a lot
will || you || be able || to get || it back
okay || you tell me || why
so || nothing || will || come || in
yeah
right
you get || over here
so || thats || not rated R
theyre || for || boys
see || all || those guys || use lightsabers
do you want to go || out || and || see || Eric
okay || right || through || the cat || door
no
yes || it || is
how || do || I know || youre telling || the truth
she taped || them || all
because || hes || the arrow shooter
right
he || can || have || it || with || a bunch || on || it || because || he wont || eat || a whole || whole bunch
okay
well || what || do you think || it || should || be || like
and || what || if || we || took || all || the walls || away
so || thats || not rated R
no || it says || youre || not supposed || to wash || it || here || inside
but || I cant || see || the names || on || the tapes
I think
Ive || got || two
you get || behind || me || okay
what || if || I || say || its || good || cereal
in || through || the hole
no || now || youre messed || up
oh || he was || a bowsman || huh
well || today || is || the day || that || I || do || it
only || big || people || can || watch rated R || right
Marky || would || come

let || Daddy || fix || it
and || you || and || Mommy
thats || a good || question
yeah
something || will || come || in
you know || what || Mom
everybody || knows || that || Dad || is || good || and || anybody || who || thinks || theyre || not || is || is || making || a joke
yeah || only || big || people || can || watch rated R || because || it has || too much sex || and violence || right
whatever || it || is || thats bothering || him || its || sure || making || it || hard || to do || my || work
its || good || cereal
boys
what kind || of || a bow || did || he || have
and || youre || going to || need || one || lightsaber || for Obi || and || one || for || Darth || and || one || for || Luke
what || do you think || it || would || be
why || do || we || have || baby || aspirin
no || wed || stay || here
no || the ceiling || would || fall || down
you || move || this || one || back || here
what
I had || a dream || about || this || big monster || that || had || a white || eye || and || a black || eye || and || it keeps || on || going destroying || things

maybe || youll || be || big || small || enough
dad || you know || what
but || you wouldnt || have any

would || you like || to || have || a dog || like || that
he || gotto || play with || the boys || and || you had || to play with

why
a || honey comb || yeah || right
well || maybe || I || did

should || we || give || it back || to || somebody
dont || feel || bad
thats || right
we || have Pepsi || I || we || have Pepsi || right || xxx
but || and
uh huh
I dont || think || I || did || I think || Ross

because || he has || a || home || he doesnt || haveto || go || in here
I want another taste
sure || all || that cold || comes || from || the arctic

Mark || you missed || a || very good concert
umhum || okay
so || who cares
what || should || that || be
then || I || should || tell || you beforehand
some || days || they || would || keep || as || many || as || thirty || seven trucks || busy
the funnest || job || the most || fun || job || is feeding || the fish || because || you know || why
oh || Ive || got || a idea
so || what did || they || do || to || him
yeah
isnt || that || right
okay || every || time || you go || to || a party || with || kids
oh || what || a great || present
would || you like || to put || that || away
really
nothing
missed || and || really || good concert || this is
you have || something || to tell me || what did || you want to tell me || the story || Mark
guess || what
did || they || take || him || away || theyre || not || going to || hurt || him
it doesnt || take || very long
even || if || she uses || that || kind || of shampoos || that || doesnt || work || I || still || like || her || I || still || like || the || look || of || her || I || still || do
we || can || put || that || away || if || you like
I see
good
listen || let || me || tell || the whole rules
but || is || there || anything || interesting || about || it || Ross
he was addressing || to || Mark || and || telling || him
good
Abbott || said || he might || still || drink || on || the || dead || man || and then || the || the sheriff || said
he was || work || he was || he || he was || gave || um || he was giving || ah Michael Knight || to get || right || to gain
do you want to put || that || away
no
daddy || why || did || you put || this upside || down
it has || little things || in || it
Ill || tell || you || the whole || deal
no
well || how
its || just || that || I like || it
theyre || just || sugar
huh
is || that || right
I wont || do || it
why || did || you || gun || by || him
and also || when || he was || in the shower || he said || he dropped || his || soap
you cant || put || everything || away || because || then || you wouldnt || have anything || to put || it || in
whenever || you go || to || a party || with || kids || you haveto || be || nice || to || all || the kids
thats || right
now || I know || what || sugar || is
daddy || did || you || take || down || those stickers
you mean || xxx || all || stuck || out
gun || him || down
why || why || what do you think || her shampoos || do || to || her
yeah
isnt || that || right || Ross
so || so || yeah || so || his || car || would || run || and || in the || back || of || thing || it || had || two || little || round || guns || in || one hid || and || when || he || and || when || he || he blasts || it || up || in the air || the little || guns || we
yeah
yeah || Ross || I || did
and he commented || on || it || and || said
and then || he said
I want || my blanket
dont || do anything
do you understand
they were messing || up || the car
go || brush || your teeth
this || soap || is || so slippery
I wont || do || it
what || what are || they
I think || I just || dropped || a bottle || on || my head
oh
oh || Daddy || next || time || we || get stickers || well || put || them || on || again
I hate || that || its || more || fun || if || I have || a blanket
are || they || bad shampoos
when || you go || to school || you haveto || be || nice || to || all || the kids || at school
I finally || found || the switch || light
I think || youve || got || the wrong || idea || Ross
yeah || the || the || one || the ones || that || they ad
I dont understand || do you understand
I want || blanket || and then || brush || teeth
I || sure || hope Todd || and || his || family || dont || get || here || too late || and || miss || it
the other || the next || the second || one || that was || funny || there || was Abbott || sitting || in the park
I wont || do || it
yeah
do you see || something || like || this
are || bad || ones
I wont || do || it
do you want to go down stairs
da || the fire || came outof || them
and || do || they || hurt || her || hair

I wont || do || it
if || they || do || well || haveto || tell || them || about || the exciting || part || they || missed

youknow || it was || a perfect || use || of || it || uh rhetorically
I dont || mean || to || hurt || you || but || I haveto || get || those pricklies || off || and || its || the only || way
maybe || theres || an Indian || there || we || didnt || hear || about
