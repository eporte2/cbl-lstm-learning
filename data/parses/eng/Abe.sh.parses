I guess || so

water melts || it
and || I would || say
and || were going to play softball || at seven
I dont want || the || I dont want || the hook || on || there
are || you going to be || a tiny seed || again
get || your coat
Daddy || know || what || I could || do
why || are mice || afraid || of mice traps
water || makes || the snow || melt
what || a silly man
can || we || play || one || of these things || doesnt belong || here
I cant || read || it
okay || Mommy
just || a second
Tarzan || the monkey || man swings || on || a rubberband
uh || after || after || I grow || big || then || I will
look || this is || fixed || now
its || a hawk
youre || gonna || stay || here || all || by yourself
oh || because || people || use mice traps || to || get mice
are || you sure
I || pretend || this is || a || um
Mommy || watch || youre || missing
just || tell || him
yeah
okay || go || get || some || things || and || put them || on || here || and || sing || the || song
hey || what || is || this
see
yeah || water
yeah || yeah
pop || goes || the rubberband
okay || where || are || your scissors || at
Ann
oh || Im gonna be || so lonely
these || are nightmares
and || I throw || it
because || people || are || seeds
can || I || draw || on || my head
does || the snow || turn || into || water
its || a || onion
oh || Im watching
down || goes || the monkey || man
really
because || mice || are || a little nuisance
then || they || grow || big
no || Lovey || would || be || here || with || you
can || you || eat || one
thats || pretty clever
see
hawks || have tongues || like || snakes
your heads || not paper
thats || neat
then || they || get || old
no
know || why || hawks || baby || hawks || are || afraid || of mousetraps
Daddy || I found || a hook
right here
snow || doesnt || turn || into || water
oh || thats good news
and Ill || guess || the answer
I dont care || to
maybe || I can draw || on your face
dont || mess || up || my cards
that || looks || like || a nightmare || alright
and then || they || get || to be || tiny || seeds || again
this || could || be || an anteaters || tongue || too
or || its || a || part || of || a || table
no || only || the || ice turns || into || water || when || you crack || the || ice
okay || one || of these things || is || not || like || the others
Daddy likes || them || though
I dont || see || them
Im not
why
it looks || like || paper
how || can || you tell || the difference between || your cards || and || Daddys || cards
because || each || time || a hawk sees || a hawk trap || it tries || to eat || the stuff || in || in the hawk trap
do || they || grow || little || first
except || why || do you call || it || a nightmare || Mom
maybe || I || lost || them
it || could || be || a || part || of || a || table
or || an anteaters || tongue
do you wanna || eat || it || on your || taco
no
only || ice turns || into || water
huh
you could || use Mommys scissors
yeah || it looks || like || paper
tell || me || which || one || is || different
dont || get || me || with || that
do || old || people || grow || little
remember || what || I told || you
I have || something || thatll || work
because || mine || cards || are || red || and || on || some || of || them || they || have || this || see
yeah
you cant || draw || on || it
sure || thankyou pardner
Daddy || I know || a different || way || to eat seeds
Im not || a ant || pretend || Daddys || a ant
where || does || the snow || go || again
because || why
or || do || they || just || turn into || seeds
do you know
Daddy || you could || draw || on your own || face
tell || me || what || you remember
Mommy || hawk || meat || is || different
a knife || a magic || knife
and || a hawk eats || the hawk trap || all
huh
this one || is || different
you know || what
here || comes || the anteater
because || hawk || meat || is || red
because || this is || a lump
they || grow || tiny || and || tiny || and || tiny
I forgot || where || the snow || goes
yeah
Daddy || I wish || that || I could || have || a knife || like || that
no || I cant
because || it || only || has || one block
and || and || later || on || when || you were || at || work || so early || I saw || a toy || on || one || of || my cards
I know || a different || way || to eat flower sunflower seeds
if || you hit || me || on || the || head || Ill || get || you
all by himself
what color || is || the taco meat
and || tell || me || why || he || has || a pointy || um tail || okay
why
and then || they || are || so || tiny
where || the birds || go || I think
if || its || your own face || you could || draw || on || it
yeah || all || up || thats || why || baby || hawks || are || afraid || of || hawk traps
yeah
maybe || we can || get || you || one || for || your birthday
brown
when || the snow || gets || there || what || do || the birds || do
but || this one || is || different
how
they || are || tiny || seeds
I will smash || your tongue
after || its || cooked
a pointy tail || like crisscross || like crisscross || okay
you get || your mouth
before || we || cook || it || its || red
because || it has || a colored block
oh || Abe || people || dont || turn || back || into || seeds
why || would || I want to || do || that
then || you get || all of || it
here || you go
a toy
I smashed || him
okay || except || that || ones || always || for || Daddys
see
yeah
Mommy || I || just || wanna || put || meat || and || lettuce || and || cheese || and || meat || in || in || my taco
thats || the airplane || I wanted
I smashed || him
and || these || are || all wooden
they || fly || this way
because || you are || the || one || that || likes || to draw || on faces
why || are || these things || on || his tail
then || you start chewing
what kind of toy
they || grow || from || seeds
can || I || look
not || always
thats || how
I dont know
oh || they || come back || here
is || it
its || for || big boys || too
nightmares || are || just || bad dreams || is || that || real
which answers || right
can || I || see
but || they || dont || turn || back || into || seeds || okay
was || Mommy || at || work early
yeah
oh
oh || I dont || like || to draw || on faces
and || I dont || wanna || put || this || in || my || tacos
I made || one || hole || in the garden || and || one || in the grass || see
how come
is || it dry
all of these || are || puzzle shapes
okay || do you want to || see if || it works
Daddy || hand || me || the scissors || the || sharp || scissors
maybe || we could || get || you || a smaller || one || thats || like || it
no || theyre || just playing
because || they || dont || like || snow
I || do
yeah || it sure || is
yeah
yeah || they || do
its || his imagination || isnt || it
hey || Dad || see || that || picture

is || this || a antique cup
carried || her || up || to || the sky
like || a hawk
watch || see

it || fell || on || its noggin
to || the moon || on || the airplane

antique || this
and || the pilot || was sitting || here
your arms crushed
what || if || we took || all || our || string
is || that || pretty fast
what || was || it
because || I saw || some || little icky || black mud

oh
do babies || try || to learn || how || to talk
it was dust
this rock || is || too || big
and || people || would || say || happy birthday || to || me
yeah || thats || pretty fast
then || it || would || go || up || to || the sky
can || I || eat || it || now
you could || break || it
wheres || my plastic canteen
if || I was || a pilot || I would || probably || get || to sit || there || too || right
when || you || see || a big || big spider || what || will || you say

how come || they || got || cars || on || them
hey || I dont want any || cheese
Mom || watch || how || fast || I could || run
its || too || big || to tie onto || this || stick
whats that
dusts || are flying || in the sky
a penny
because || it || would land || on || my head || when || it || came || down
I didnt || break || it
what did || you do || with || it
the ScarletKing || snake

I will || after || you || eat || your waffles

we || would || just || go || to || a || store || with || with || a badge || on ourselves
Mommy || I cant find || that || other || animal || like || that

how || do you know
the prince || said
why || are || you || so || sad
wow
in || where
why
okay
Lou || and Elliot || are || going to || come
nope
I dont know
why
oh || maybe || we could || do || it || on || the back
okay || what || was || your || idea
Mommy
wasnt || that || hard
in the dragon

quite || a few || huh

I dont know
all of || them escaped
and || it || didnt || fall || off
about || eight oclock
maybe || I can fix || it

not || many || a couple || weeks || at most
yeah

the first || time || that || we went || there || as || far || as || when || we had || a picnic || last night
okay || hey
do you think wed || be || very comfortable
that was || glass || and || was || hot
what are || you going to use || it || on
Im wiping || it up
because || he wants || he wants everyone || to || think || he runs || real fast || hey
right
what || was || it
how about || if || I keep || that || one || there
yeah || even || a dog || a coyote || would || have || no trouble attacking || a dog || either
before || we || go || before || we || go || we better || get || the tickets
good || thing || it wasnt || Amaras || either
no
Im wiping || it up
well || would || we || stay || for Christmas
Chris || and || one || of || his || friends || and Mista

why dont || you tell || Daddy || why
what || have || you been || doing || all day
the tv
I didnt || take || them apart
and || that makes || it || cook
because Santa || could || keep || that || one || there
Mom || are || you || gonna be || a nurse
I dont think || Chris knows || where || Amara || lives || oh
hey || Mom || the feathers
what || was || that
uhuh || were || probably || going to rent || a cabin || for || some || days
and || the towel || caught || on fire
I was || real cranky || if somebody || went || to school || and || they || were cranky || that || would || make || me mad
huh
right
I just || cut || the top || off || and || took || the insides || out
thats right
oh || Abes || going to go || in the seventeenth || for || his physical
we could use infinitylogs || to build || it || that || would || make || it || very || big
Mom || the feathers
oh || sure || we can || go || that || far
playing
the wind
and || we could || keep || this one || here
just || one bite || and || the dog || would || be || dead
I hope || to someday
I || been || playing || all day

you || thought || I couldnt || see || anything
theyre || little snaps
do you want || me || to be || the farmer
no || keep || baking || it

now || Im gonna || try || to have || the guy || stand || up here
and || a boat || found || him
if || you buy || it || it || will || be || already || cooked
because || it was || too || long
no
yeah
yeah
but || its || because || this is bent
are || you going to be || the farmer
what did || you break
I had || a funny || dream || last night
uhhuh
so || you wont || haveto cook || it
nothing || really
right || do you want some tea
no || Daddy || is
Im || Daddy
all || these armies || they tried || to shoot || red || coat
hi || oh Silver
no
but || that breads || not very nutritious
so || you get || far || away
how come
no || not yet
no || I want to be || the farmer
if || you buy WonderBread
because || I dont || like || tea
hes || not || ready
and || instead || of || red coat || they shooted || a cloud
it || is || if || you want to buy WonderBread || you can
Mom || would || you turn || this || back || on
Daddys || yellow || again
thats || a good reason
Mommys || blue || again || okay
okay
what
where || did || you || taste WonderBread
okay
okay Pop
this || I wanna || put || this record || on
just || a second
I like WonderBread
I got || a || one
Jean buyed || some || one || time
no || I didnt || really
okay
and || she gived || me || a taste
hey || thats || the silver
it was || already || on || the || ones
where || did || you find || this
and || once || we went || grocery shopping || with Jean || when she || was babysitting || me
so || I dont || get || a || one
on || the floor
man || is || it snowing
they || go || on Silvers saddle
let me || see || wow thick || big
its thick
yeah || because || theyre diamonds
and || I tasted || those cherries
Momma || Im || first
hey || they || also || have bullets || hey || Momma
Im || the farmer
they || were delicious
what did || you || taste
what
his tail || is || rubber
those cherries
oh yeah || that || time
yeah || he || can || move || it back || and forth
we should || start buying || those cherries || again
some || of these || designs match || the designs || on his saddle || see
theyre || outof season
oh
yeah
pears || and tangerines || are || in season || now
does || this || have || a story || without Tonto
but || when || its || winter || none || most || not || too much || fruit || is || in season
I dont think so
but || we should || go || to || all || the || apple orchards || when || its getting || close || to || winter
what || if || we || dont || let || them || be || friends || yet
its || up || to || you
then || we could buy || some || good || apples
lets || pretend || they || didnt become || friends || yet
we could buy || some || cut || apples
I wanna pretend || they || didnt || even meet
or || we could buy || some || bread || that || isnt || cut
I like || the || ones || that || are || cut || best
wheres || his || horse
hey
you could || see || his || teeth
I like || it || when || its || cut
somebody || knocked || the LoneRanger unconscious
you know || why
why || would || they || do || that
because || you || dont || haveto cut || it
because || theyre || having || a war || see
oh
theyre || having || a fight
we could buy || it || at TomThumb || first
and || the LoneRanger || winned
why
oh || even || though || he || was || knocked unconscious
because || its running || outof || bread
theyre || running || outof || bread
uhhuh
thats || why
so || why || should || we || try || there || first
to try || and || see || how much || it costs
oh
but || if || it doesnt cost || too || good || well || put || it back
and well || try another || store
Dad || didnt || it || surprise || you || when || you came || home
Abe || was || surprised || too
I was || so surprised
I falled || in || love || with || the couch
I falled || in || love || with || the living room
why
because || it looks || so || good
Dad || likes || the bedroom
because || it looks || so || good
Dad || can || sleep || in the closet
and || Mom || can || sleep || in the bed
youre crazy
