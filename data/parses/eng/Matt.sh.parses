look at || my || gate || look at || my || gate
I wonder || Im not sure || if Ryan ever || saw || Harry Potter
maybe Ill || make || them || something || to drink || because || they || might || get thirsty || too
me || I thought || you might || want to || dump || them || in
its kind of || a cloudy || isnt || it
I || took || off || his || face
I better || put || more || in || its || gonna be || a || long snake
because || we || got || new || what did we get || in || our kitchen

why
look at || your || gate

I think || that || it || is
new flooring
now || where || are those || rocks || that || hes || gonna || get

it says || help Whinny || the || Pooh || find || his favorite tree
hes plant eater || so || he would || eat || those || right

bring || her || something || she hasnt seen
xxx || he || cant || go through || it
new flooring
can || I || take || these || off
so || now || you have || a stool || again || but || dont step || on || it again

what || long acorn
I || want || I wanna || hide || in here
its || gotta || go through || the door
ah || nothing || right
Ryan || doesnt || know || the story
do you wanna || talk about || this
a fireman
he says || hes || doing || some || other || things || honey
the || one || that was long || that was || from || your classroom
a bottle
there
I dont || think || thats || one || no || thats || not || one
a fireman || oh || boy
yeah
um || hum
its || for || my || its || for || my tortoise || in here
its || gotta || go through || the door || huh
is he || gonna || pick || up || any passengers || or || anything
remember || you || and || daddy || went || in || the hotel || a bunch || of times
you wanna || hide || in there
let me || fall || down
general area
a flag
what is || this thing || anyway
what || was || that
can || you open || this one
lets || go || see
someone || broke || that bottle
they || should || be || in || the general area || okay || so || where || are these || gonna || go
now || does || this || plane || go || on || the ground || or || where does || this plane || go
how about || this one
I || can || let || you || fall || down || on || the couch
they || have alot || of || pizza || going || to || the baby
lets || go || see || where || are || we || going
yeah
I forget
its || this thing || it scares trains || away
the rain
and || I didnt || get || this || for Christmas || but || I thought || you might || think || its || cool
maybe somebody || broke || it
what did we || do with || this one || one || time || when || we had || Erin || over
yeah || we || can || open || that one
there || you go
yeah
are || you || hiding || in || the pool
but || how many times || did || I || go swimming || with || you guys
you forget
a sword
um || hm
do you remember || why || we put || that || why || we started using || this humidifier
what should we || do || to || do || the puzzle || first
they must || have || broke || it || because || theres || just || that one || little || piece || left
there || he goes
just || somewhere
that || baby || is || hungry || I bet || right
okay ready
maybe || he doesnt || want to || tell || that || story || because || it was || one || that || he borrowed || and || he || was || not || supposed || to || take || it
it scares trains || away
whatd || you guys || do || in || the rain
in || this aisle
oh || no || look at || how many swords || we found
how || I think || theres || something || that might || go || on || the back || of || it
just somewhere || huh
yeah
uh || oh
there || he goes
in || this aisle || okay
in || the sky
one
yeah
xxx || xxx || hide || under || the water
so || he says || I || would || like some || more pizza || please
uh || oh || I think || you mushed || your || book
what did we put inside || this || car
I || do || think || its || cool
walk || where || he || is
I || put || that one || there || right there
just || one || yes
but || I never || saw || a train
there || he goes
where does || that one || go
maybe || that giraffe || broke || it
where || should we put || the oranges
hey || actually || this is || the same || kind of || dinosaur
because || because || my tortoise || sometimes || gets dried || out
walk || where || he || is || well || we cant || go || all || the way || back || there
these || are || scary || ones
why || just || one
there || he goes
how || does || it || work
yeah || it looks like || there || is || something || that might || go || on || the back || of || it
maybe || that giraffe broke || it
on || the road
you wanna || put || that one || right there
you haveto || hide || under || the water
but || yeah || we || dont know || if || it works || yet || because || its || true || we havent || yet || seen || a train
right here
do they || eat anything || else except || for || pizza || in || this family
theres || the passenger || truck
uh || oh || the || guy || got mushed || uh || oh
thats || a lot || of swords || but || it looks like || we won || though || because || you gotta || get three || in || a row || and || see || heres || one two three || three || in || a row
I think || I was || doing || work || or || maybe || the water || was || cold
oh poor giraffe
as || this one
on || the road || right here
and || these || goes || and || this || and || these || go || in || this part
well || you just haveto || push || it
oh || yep
yeah || tell || him || what happened || to || this || car || whatd || we || do
because || he || was || getting dried || out || yes
there || he goes
he || did || not || break || it
well || what should we || do with || these || pieces
so || we had || to bring || it back
well || then || and then || if || you || hide || under || the water || then || no || one || will || see || you
oh my gosh || which || one || might || be || the mommy || one
look || what || oh || no
he crashed || into || the || what
why
oh || yeah
well haveto || see if || theres || any directions || or anything
theres || the passenger || truck
yeah
because || hes || like || in || the back woods
this || goes || in || this part
oh || okay
he || got || kinda || mushed || oh || well
oh || thats interesting || it || can || go || on || there || even
because || it was || not || our acorn || right
that || water || was || cold
the lake
what else || would || they || eat
should we put them || out || so || we || can || see || them
we had || to get || it out
and then || now || hes || gonna || go || to || where
yep
but || what || do you gotta || do when || a train || comes || with || this
do you want me || to || do you want || us || to || take || him || out || and || show || you || him
I think || this one || is || the mommy || one
why || he || is
looks like || theyre || all done
what are || you eating
oh || yeah || see || I think || you can || make || him || fly
should we || close || it || okay
they || eat hot dogs
is he || gonna unload || him || now
do you wanna talk about || what || we || are || going || to || do tonight || what || thing || we || are || going || to get || at || the store
that || is || a pretty || good place || to || hide || but || you gotta || make || sure || you || come || up || and || take || a breath
I have || no || idea || why || he || is || actually
we had || to || what
theyre || watching || the movie
a pay
oh || look at || that
they || eat hot dogs || anything || else
yes || he || did
the map || the map
I dont know
jumped || over || gate
wanna || get || a new || one || like || this
I kinda || like || that one
we had || to get || it out
he || said || he || was || not || there
a pay
yep || I think || that part || goes || right || in there
have || you || um || ever || saw || the Rugrats || movie
theyre watching || a || movie
oh || you shake || it
I dont know || how || to || do || the puzzle
but || thats || very prickly || back || there
yep
okay
jumped || over || the gate || sure || did
a cash register
what else
I || like || his || little spikes || right there
now || lets || do
he says || I was || at || my own || house || I || did || not break || it
we had || to get || it out || yeah || we filled || the whole || car || with playdough
Monsters Inc
pizza
if || you want || sure
a cash register
why || dont || we || just || go || look at || him
I || did || not || know || that trains || were || scary
you wanna || get || a new || one || like || that
um hm
you dont want to || do || the puzzle
I think || it || is || the new || Harry Potter || movie || because || I dont || oh || this is || oh || I dont || think || it || is || because || its || the next || Harry Potter || movie || because || it has || because || I dont || see || because || I dont || see || it || have || this thing || with || it
can || you help || Sully || open || the door || that takes || him || to visit || his friend || Boo || if || you discover || three || door knobs || then || we get Monsters Inc || book || for free
hot dogs || and || pizza
come || back || and then || come
wheres || the movie being shown || wheres || the screen
did you think || of || that || when || you said pay
yeah
he || can || walk || around
because || you haveto breathe || you cant breathe || under || water || right
I saw || it
he looks || kind of || mean || though || do you think || maybe || he was || kind of || a mean || dinosaur
anything || else
we could || just || look at || him || yes || thats || a good idea
um || I || got || Im || gonna || get || a green sweater
he says || wait || for || me || wait || for || me
right here
you || did
I dont know || I dont know || how || puzzle
we already || got || this one || used || remember
how || do you know || that trains || need || to be scared || away
he || did || not break || it
should we || take || him || out
yep
right there || okay || here
we || got || it out || though || didnt || we
did you like || it
remember || at || the museum || yesterday || they had || a part || where || you could choose || the groceries || and pay || for || them
how about || do they || eat mushrooms
what || do you want to play with || should we || play with || the animals || or || do you wanna || play || like || were || at || the store
he says || wait || for || me || dont || go without || me

its || like || its || like || when || hes || in || the cage || he || just || looks like || this || too
oh my gosh || that car || is full || of || pizza || are || there any hot dogs || in there || too
I dont know || how || do
no || hes || a plant eater
because
something Monsters Inc
oh || I || like || green
no
he || got || it
because || the drivers || will || be scared
whyd || you fill || it || with playdough
one || of || the reasons || Erin || came || back || though || is || because || she || didnt || get || to hear || the whole || story || of Shrek || so || I thought || we could || tell her || it together || even || though || shes || never || seen || the movie
okay || so || do || we || wanna || do || this one || which || one || should || I choose || first
oh || its || supposed || to be || something || from Monsters Inc || well || I || do || not || know where Monsters Inc || is
you dont know || how || to || do || it || well || well || do || it together
a plant eater || oh
he || got || it
yeah
me || too
on tv
we || dont || even || have || any shoes || on
was || that || fun
and || that || thats || the cash register || I ate
the drivers || will || be scared
yeah
I dont know

thats || my favorite || color
so || are || the plant eaters || nice || ones
did you get tired || swimming
I || want to play || at || the store
oh || great job || he || got || on || before || he || left
really
oh || how come || they || will || be scared
so || you think || that || it must || be || from || the second || Harry Potter || movie || because || they || did || not || have || this || in || the first || movie
you dont know
hes || gonna || get || all prickled || up || in there
here || heres || some || hot dogs
in || the cage || he || just || looks || what || Matty
thats || my || thats || my favorite color
yeah || I dont either

that was || the || one
nope || I || just breathe
just || did
oh || you want me || to || do || the coconut || one || first || or || you wanna || do || Monsters Inc
yeah
now || how || are || you gonna || see through || the front || window || with || all || of || the || pizza || there
I dont know
they || would || hear || the sound || and || they || would || think || it was || a meat eater
well || here || this is || from Monsters Inc
they || have || movies || and || they || have || just || the || show || honey
yeah
oh || you just || were breathing || you said || oh || you just breathe
he says || its || very prickly
oh

he looks || the same || as || hes || the same as || in || his cage
but || whos || gonna || get || to play with || that cash register || now
we || just || put || a little bit || in || and then || we filled || the whole || thing || up
but || but || this one || is || like || just || like || a plant eater || and || a meat eater
so || you want to get || your cash register
hey || look || what || we found || though
it || really || is
remember || what || this part || is called
oh || now || youre || under || the water || again

before || he left
I || can reach || it
oh || I || see || he doesnt change || much || when || you || take || him
so || were || gonna || get || a green sweater || and then || what else || are || we || gonna || get || because || we had || some ideas || about || when || grandma and grandpa || are || here

throwed || up || yes
I || know || how || you like || to || do || that || sometimes
I petted || them

here || I got || it
so || when Harry Potter plays Quidditch || how || does || he win || the game
maybe
I || gonna || eat || them || now

and Jackson Booth
Dino Dinosaurs

oh
and || the lions || were sleeping || and then woke || up || and then || he was waking || up || his || daddy || lion
how come || it wont || pop || out || anymore
cats || have ants || bird cries wolf || and || remember || the other || one

I think || thats pretty cool || youre || getting || a dinosaur || room
its || supposed || to be || a girl
I dont know || maybe mess || up || the food
xxx || eat || this
its not || a || bird || though
how || could || he protect himself || do you think || the brontosaurus
Jackson Booth || is || mean
so || I missed || this || because || I was || working || what else || did you || and Daddy || do today || besides || go || to Mikes
then || xxx || where || you were
snow
what color || car || would || you || choose
spraying || people spraying || people spraying || people
mhm || on || to Dannys || back
for || the teachers || and Cheryl
no || no || remember Doctor Weist || will listen || to || your || tape || later
uh || oh || were || gonna || get || them
the big || ones || Cody || went || on || were || like || bigger than || the || ones || I || went || on
we live || in the closet
oh || momma || momma || I thought || we were || gonna || get || a dog
oh || yeah
well || what is || the other || movie || called Dinosaurs
snow
Im not || actually || sure || if || it || is
maybe mess || up || the food
remember || its || a pterodactyl
hey || why || cant || pop || it back || up
thats true || I || might || not || know where || you went
I think || that would || be || pretty neat
now || what || was || it || doing
um Id || choose || a green || one
drawing || the line
hes || mean || too
book || shes || got || there
now || I || remember || something || that || you guys sounded || like || you were playing || a cowboy || game || is that || right
he would || just || run
spraying || people
and || anybody || else || should we get presents || for || or || do you think || thats enough
oh
um tasty
we could || but || it || would || be || kind of || small
but || were || going || to || his || party || anyway
drawing || the line || yep || you remembered || all || the names || thats || good
why || would || it || mess || up || the food
yeah
I dont know || is || she || in || it
so hell || be curious || as || to || what || I brought || you || for || a snack
okay || so || they || were || first || sleeping || thats right || and || one woke || up || and then || he was || walking || up || the || daddy || lion
yeah || what are pterodactyls || kind of || like || theyre || a || kind of || what
it was || fall falling
spraying people
I dont know
they || eat || the little || dinosaurs
youd || choose || a green || car
I have || some food
thats || the name || of || the || one || movie || weve been watching || alot || of || dinosaur || movies || right
but || he ran || but || he || still || got eaten
yup || were looking forward || to || it
what || book || is that
what would || she || say
I dont know || it doesnt || look like || that || to || me
thats || what || I was wondering
no || it wasnt falling
you decided || you wanted || to go || right
maybe || because || it || might || put sugar || in the food || and || it doesnt || need sugar
I || see || the || ones Cody || went || on || were || bigger than || the || ones || you went || on
it || just shows || one || person
oh || they || eat || little || dinosaurs || yeah || sometimes || thats || what would happen || the big || ones || would || eat || the little || ones
maybe || I || can || take || some || of || this
like || the || kind || that || we have || or || a different || one
Dinosaurs
shed || say || we || did || get lots || and lotsof || dogs
who || wants || to live || in || a || closet

a different || kind
my || Mommy || brought || me || a || um || a Reeses

a table
cookie || monster
daddy
youre || not || a plant eating || dinosaur
theres || a || party || part || and then || the people || turn || into bones

oh || oh || I just remembered || Ryan || doesnt || know || what || movie || you went || to go || see || with || daddy
this || time || I wanna || do || it || on || here
a table || okay
thats || what || your || mommy taught || you
daddy || thats true
I caught || some tadpoles
or || by || your head || sure
and || one time || it || went past
so || um
at || the fair
Im || Im || Im not || gonna invite || Roman
what if || the dinosaur || tried || to eat || this
it || could || be
here || I || took || the tape || off || so || you could || check
they were || about || their legs || were || about || this tall || and || their bodies || was || about || maybe || as || big as || your body
who else
yes || you caught || some tadpoles
this one || too
he keeps flipping || over
did || Ryan || ever || hear || the story || of || how || we went || to || the ocean || this summer
no
okay
because || I forget
oh || so || there || was || a rat || in there || in the movie || too
wait || what are || you doing || to || my ear
yeah || youre || right || because cupcakes || come || in || those || little containers except cupcakes || are || usually || a little taller
I dont || think anyone || else
so || he almost || got || two goals || on Monday
a mean neighbor || yes || what did || the mean neighbor || do
how about || grandpa Dale
on || the other side
the Green Goblin || does || some || of || them
that one || too || so || those || are || ones || that || we cant || use

oh || you gonna || set || that || up
good news
wow || maybe || next || time
Harry || Harry Potter || and || the Chamber || of Secrets

cookie monster || be very || careful
that || is || a funny || idea
but || um || you know || theyre || just || little || kids
I || like tadpoles
ah || sure
youre || gonna invite Marissa || well || that would be || nice
you think || its || a couch
we drove || and drove || and drove || and drove || and drove || and drove || and drove || and drove || and drove
bang
so || this is interesting || so || some || work || and || some || dont || right
yep
look || my fingers || are || stuck
what if || the dinosaur || wants || to eat || the money
what do you think || they || would || think || about || that || place

Templeton
Harry Potter || and || the Chamber || of Secrets

and || their legs || were || that tall || so
fishies

that would be || neat
Duncan || isnt || in our || books || or || movies
we were climbing || the rocks
remember || the big mountain
but || you know || I || do || not || know || how || to take care || of || a dinosaur
what || could || they || do || the wrong || thing || about
soccer
did || they || get injured || or || are they fine
um hm
he || should || be Petre
oh my
I || like || this one || we || like || to try || and || get || this one
um um || theres lots || and lotsof || food || for || dogs || at || that || barn || over || there
youre || gonna || play || soccer
anybody || need || some gas
okay
yes
its Spider Mans || web
mhm
theres || a lot || of books
you just
we were climbing || the rocks
Duncan starts || with || D
yeah
okay
yes || we went hiking || on || a big || big mountain
do you remember || that
alright || Im || going || to take || all || these || home || heres || your money
yeah || at || my new || school
did you wear || a hat || too
here || we || go
they || could || put || the stuff || in the wrong || thing
the garbage || man helped || us || because || he picked || it up
put || my hand || right there
now || as soon || as || you get || your hands washed || we can || play || them || okay
what if || the baby || thought || all || those || were || real || and || she || got || scared
and || youre || what
just || like || that for || right || now
what did we || do with || some || of || the shale
I forget
so || wheres || a || D
it will || not || because nobody || because || because || Im || the person || that || doesnt || want || people || to get gas || just || me
that sounds || like || a lot || of fun
can || you get || it out
what does || he || do || to || that || cat
yep
what do || I || haveto || do || to take care || of || him
and || youre || Spider Man
where || did || he || keep || going || into || when || I kept saying || no || no || no || dont || go || in there

um || actually || my hood
theres || some food || for || dogs || at || the barn || over || there

hes helping || him || at || this part || and || the cat loves || him
that helped || a lot || didnt || it
so || youre || gonna be Little Foot || and || Ill || be Petre || then

Spike || okay
hello

worm balls
are || we || gonna help || him || put them || away
do || do || do you know || what binoculars || are
you got || it
okay

what were || you helping || daddy || do
just || one more
these || are || right here
a boy
well || okay thank || you || very much
how || do you know
okay || but || what if || I dont || have enough || gas || to get || to || that one
I dont || think || they || are balls
like || we havent || done Thomas || or || anything || yet
after || you touch || him || you just haveto wash || your hands
yeah || look at || those || little spikes
whats || the baby || boys || name
whoa || you almost || got || it
does || he || eat || like || a lot || or || a little
yeah
binoculars
water || them
I dont || think || thats Aladar || do you
youre || right || he throws || the garbage
because || I || remember
yeah
yeah || thats right || that would be || nice
yeah
hey || I have || a question || for || you
water || them
so || if || you could || be || one || dinosaur || what || one || would || you || be
oh || thats || another || way || to || do || it
okay
wheres Thomas
tell her || how || you get || to || there
like || this
no || whatre || they || for
we || will || though || we haveto || help || him || because || theres || gonna be || too many || to || put || away
I was wondering || about || how much hell || wanna || eat
where || were || you
I think || it || is || it looks like || Aladar || to || me
oh || okay thatd || probably || be || a good idea
and || we were throwing || it || and || hit || the rock || and explode
the garbage || can || in there || but || but || but || he || he || then takes || it out || and then puts || it back || on || the ground
a lot
Thomas || xxx
oh || but || what is || this || boy || doing with || the cat
I was || spraying || my eyeball || out
are || you doing || something || to || your || house || inside || maybe
you just || um || if || the || um || if || the other || place || says || theres || no more || gas || you can || just || come || to || this one
in || my tummy || and || you remember || that
theyre || for || things || very far || away
a lot
there || you go || you got || that one
that works || you hit || it || with || another || pin
so || should || I buy || all || these || maybe
you were spraying || your eyeball || out
what || part || is that || by
what does || this || look like
um || probably || Ill || be || a Longneck
okay
remember || that orange || stuff || when || we were climbing || around || on || the rock || that || we took || home
how much || he might || wanna || eat
in the basement
wow
well || you || xxx || that none || of them || were dangerous || but || they || are fighting
see || it || kinda || looks like Aladar || but || then || why || would || he || have such || a mean || face
hes || pulling || his || tail
whats Thomas || start || with || if || you || look at || the letter
if || you bang || it || on || the floor || it || might || break || so || dont || push || it || all || the way
do you want to || do || it again
under || the || eye balls
a persons || head
yeah
did you spray || your dad
now || its || Ryans || turn
we || dont || even || know || maybe || which boxes || to || put them || in || so || I think || we should || probably || start cleaning || up || pretty soon || okay
okay
Longneck
he || usually || has || maybe || this || much || this || much tomato
oh || no
what does || your tortoise || eat
you know || I || remember || in || about || is he || gonna || get || any || bigger
yeah longnecks || are || the || kind of || I think theyre || kind of || nice
what happens || after || you get || them || all || down
what are || you || saying || about || the basement || though
can || you see || me
remember || what || part || does || he || scratch || him
theres || no || eye balls || up || there || where || is || it || at
yeah
T
have || you seen || how || that works
I think || it || is || Aladar || because || look || its || the same || one
he eats tomatoes || and || lettuce
you got || it
yup || we || did || take || that || home || youre || right
yeah
you || did
because || they || xxx || they || all || want to live || in || a certain spot
mhm
yeah
oh || okay || okay
whats || going || on || in the basement
yeah
right there || he gets scratched || by || the cat
theres || that one
it still || catch || down || there
where || is || it || they || xxx || making || up || xxx
and || he || said || if || I got || him || wet || he would || throw || a bug || at || me
maybe || this || much lettuce
tomatoes || and lettuce
I forget
um um || were playing || Land Before Time || the first || one || when || they || go || to || the great valley
its || very interesting
what am || I || doing
ah || hes || hes || already || big
thats pretty || nice
yeah
the orange || stuff
his bowl || is || actually || like || this isnt || it
I thought || he || looked || mean || like || how || kinda || like Croan || looked || mean
do you remember || what || they call || it || when || you get || them || all || down
you || did
so || it picks || it up || and || it picks || up || the garbage || can || but || then || it puts || the garbage || can || back || down
daddys || fixing || a || light || because || if || you touch || it || then || youll || get electric shock
it still catches || down || there || yeah
thank || you
waving || your hand || at || me
that sounds || good
we took || the orange || kind of || rock || home || that || is true
oh || hes || already || big || alright || because || I was wondering || if Ryan || should || buy || a new || house || to keep || him || in
they were || making || up || some || of them
is || it || in the middle || of || the track
why || get scratched || by || the cat
how || am || I || gonna decide || who gets || to live || in the best spot
a couple || more minutes
so || if || he || really || really || needs gas || then || he || can || come || to || yours
so || put || in || like || a good amount || of || lettuce || and then || some tomato || on || the side || or || something
and || he || he || really likes sweet || ones
you can || see || me
can || we get || all || these things || out
this is Harold || the Helicopter
he || did || he || said || if || you got || him || wet || he would || throw || a bug || at || you
oh || no
its || like || in the || part || where || people || jump || over || the || xxx trees pit
do you think || the cat || likes having || his tail pulled
so || did || Roman || sleep || here || all || night
oh || yeah || we || still || gotta || open || our boxes
ohmygoodness
yeah
what does Harold || start || with
and then || we || did || something afterwards || because || we got || hot || but || we didnt || want to swim || in the lake
oh || okay || so || hes || fixing || a light
sweet || ones

I dont || think || there || will || be || time || to get || all || of them || out || honey
now || she || put || her || in || a || hiding || place
ah || what are those
um || Ill || come || over || right || now || and || see || whats || going || on
how about || me

yeah || my || house || isnt || very || big

soccer || sounds || like || its || gonna be || pretty || fun
what happens || to || the garbage

do you have || some gas
um hm || so || what happens || with || the trains

and then || you were || super || cold || right
okay || so || they || just haveto divide themselves || up || huh || and || find || different areas || to live || in
what || word || did you say
I tried || and then || we || did || and then || we threw || it back || in
uh || oh || that ones || gone

mhm
um hm
meteor shower || again
then || then || he was || doing || good job || he was || doing || good job || eating healthy || food || and then || he was || bigger
okay || so || lets see || we || still || have || another chance || to || open || them || another || time || okay

Im || a little bit afraid || of || meat eaters
where || did you go fishing

well || when || we went || to || the ocean || I || cut myself
work || with || Daddy
youre || gonna sacrifice || one || of || your friends

when || are || we || going || home

but || its || a || really
yep
hey || we saw || a || movie || with || these || kinds || of lizards || in || it
free || now || should || I || call || this || a bed || is || this || like || a bed

ohmygoodness || is he telling || him || no
why || were || they meowing || in the middle || of || the || night
you know || what || they call || it || when || you buy || a || person
I said || she || kinda || gets eaten
do you have || dinosaurs || on || the wall

theyre || not || theyre || not || really arguing || anymore || but || you know || Im afraid || about || something || that || could happen || tonight
is he || trying || to protect || his || baby
watch || this
oh || I see || so || if || it || had || this || much || more || on || it || it || would be || the same size || as || the other || thing
I || I || I triget
she || might || get eaten || thats true
tell || him || what || the rules || are
not yet
leave || the || cover || open || and || he sleeps || in || it
that was || pretty || good
yeah
what
I triget
ohmygoodness || remember || that movie
mhm || he || is || the little || one
okay
because || we werent feeding || them || that || much
not yet
yeah || you decided || not || to || because || then || your || daddys || back || would || hurt || more || yeah || that || could happen
theyre || called slaves
you know || I hadnt || thought || about || that || but
do || a good job
do you remember
do you know || what || this is
I just || have || dinosaurs || on || my || bed || and || stuff

what if || this one tries || to fly || away || though
is that || okay
Billy bang Billy bang
let me || show || you guys || how || to || do || this || okay
the pterodactyl || also
theyre captured
when || you get || home || you || eat || it
he took || a bite || out || of || me

theyre captured || yeah
yeah
whats || this
how come
how shall || I || choose || which || one || gets || to go home || with || him
oh || what do you think || where || should || she || sleep
okay
that was || a good || way
what would happen || if || you just drank || something || in the store
should || I || keep || him || in the house
this is || kind of weird || look at || this || bottom || thing
so || that || actually stays || in || that || room
uh || you die
what do you do || once || they || give || you || the candy
wow || that || light || is || so awesome
for real
do you remember || the way || to || the Great Valley
it was || in there
only || how many || more || days || of || that || though
oh || yeah || grandpa Dale
Ive never || seen || anybody || do || it || that way
um hm
yeah
is || this || gonna || go || in there || somewhere || you think
can || I see || how || you put || in the people
freeze || them off
was || it
but || the boys || didnt die || right
now || where || should we || keep || the light || you know || because || theyre || kinda spread || out
he || can || eat || this || paper
uh || which ones || your favorite
whats || this || look like
you say || thank || you
okay || ring || it up
youll || never || know || what || youll || find || in there || huh
one
yeah
freeze || them off || so || is || this || what || they || do
you || would || go || to jail
time || to go home
he || can || eat || this paper || okay
what
one
no
theres || gotta || be || something || that goes || in the middle
Im not sure || what || these || are || supposed || to || do
thank || you || and then || you get || to take || the candy || home || right
hm || should || he || choose || or || do you think || it || would be || mean || for || him || to choose || his best || friend
I guess || I can || have || another || one
time || to go home
can || I check
he || does
well youd || haveto pay || for || it || at least
one
no
I think || hes eating || it
one
so || what do you want to || do today
how about || a couple || more minutes || Boo
yeah
I want || I want to || put || it || in || one || of || the boxes
is that || what || he says
just || one more || day
just anywhere || maybe || if || I || put || it up || here || in the sky || in || a tree || or || something
go || like || this
I didnt || find || the ball
is || they || just || put || you || in || a freezer || here || we || go
why
he likes || it || he || ate || it || all gone
great idea || Matty
because || theres || a big || whole
guess || you can || have || another || one
time || to go home
oh || wait wait wait || very dangerous
theres nothing || in || it
so || you got || a bunch || of || candy || and then || the next day || I think || it was || there || was || a huge parade || right
I dont know
yeah
thats || okay
this is harder
maybe || this || dinosaur || does || not || have || a stomach
remember || what || he says
I want to
do you wanna || sell || me || anything || or
theres nothing || in || it || because || I drank || the whole || thing
but || theyre || a different || set || honey
no || you didnt
because || they || all || go || there
um excuse || me || I need || to return || him
okay Mattys || in the freezer || lets freeze || off || those spots
I || know || somebody || who || went || into || one || of || those chest || things
watch || this
maybe || you || should
why || are || you getting || hungry
yeah

then || all || of them || will || have || light || does || that sound || like || a good idea
he says || I dont || haveto || remember || mom || cause || youll || be || with || me
mhm || you want me || to fix || it
its || really || hard

look || how || big || of || a dog || that || is
because || um || I got || more goals
oh || they must || be || free || then || right
so || then || what does || he || do with || his || daddy || in the || this || ah || because || you know || he || kinda || has || a decision || to make || right || at || the end || to make || a choice || what does || he || end || up || doing
oh || is || this one dollar
I think Squidworth || is || just || really || kinda || I dunno || hes || in || a bad mood || like everyday || right

I was || gonna || say || that Helga || doesnt || know || the story || about || when || you went || to church || and || you got
invite || some || of || your || animal || friends || to come

how || scary
yeah || and || how || did we set || up || the couch || so || it || would be very comfortable
look || it || xxx || can || you do something || because || the inks spreading
so || then || we went || to Sullivans || and || that was || cool || right
um || Im gonna || tell || him || xxx || with || this
we went || to || an art || museum
whatd || you do when || he || did || that
I gotta || pay || for || more seeds || but || it was || your || idea || to put them || in the bathtub
sleeping || bag
tell her || about || that
what does || sleeping bag || end || with
what are || you gonna || to tell || him
in Florida
ohmygoodness || I think || the || bad lizards attacked || the people || and || the animals || on || the farm
nothing || just leave
except || you guys || kept || trying || to take || that ketchup
this ones || my || very || favorite
yeah || I know || those || are || kind of || a || wet markers || arent || they
he wouldnt || jump
Florida
um hm
oh || yeah || I got || a todays || um || I mean || I got || it || at school || that || day || and also || I || went || to church || that || day || and || I got || the same || thing
g
um || let me || tell || him
you told || me || actually || something || that || happened || one || day || when || I was || at || work || because || daddy || has || been || off || work || all || week || so || you stayed || home || with || daddy || on Monday || and then || there || was || something || that || happened || in terms || of || your || not feeling || well || do you remember || that
those soft || big pillows || and || things || on || the couch
he was || inside || a glass
in Florida || are || you sure || it was || in Florida
yeah || sleeping bag
and || he || cannot || get || his arm || out
okay || which || one || do you like || next || after || that
um || what || I meant || with || the bathtub || thing || is || to get || water || out || of || the bathtub
sleeping || also ends || in g || doesnt || it
dont || be scared || of || those || ones || that || have sharp teeth
what were || you gonna || do with || that ketchup || there
um hm || we set || up || the pillows || and || the hot || um heating pad || right
and then || he turns || just || into || what
yeah
the || one || I || put || down || is || the || one || that || is || my || very || favorite
theyd || probably || be || pretty || scared || if || all || a sudden || this giant || giant || lizard || came || to their || town
thats || why || Im || only || using || one || at || a || time
yes || because || youre || not || gonna sleep || the whole || night || there || but || Daddy || has parent teacher conferences || so || you gotta || stay || at their || house || for awhile
oh || well || tell her || about || what || you saw || at || the art || museum
oh
you just || tell || them
what do you think || he || turn || into || at || the end
he didnt seem || very || happy || to be || in the cage || or || in the glass aquarium || so || we || let || him || go
yeah || I was || a little worried
oh || I see || we had || a misunderstanding || I was || just || supposed || to get || water || out || of || the bathtub
thats || why || youre || only using || one || at || a || time || because itd || be || a huge huge || mess
your || very favorite || is || the || one || that goes || down || okay

and || he had || made || remember || Matty || pictures || of || president Bush || and || president Lincoln || or something
no
how come
we played || we played || this game || it was || called || um || kick || the || can

oh wow
um || I dunno
its || in
talk about || what || what || you guys || might || do
you think || it || would be || a lot || of || work
is || this || their lawn

lets || go || today
yeah || its || our house
Washington || maybe || it was || George Washington || you made
it || is || only || on Sundays || for || kids

hm || I dunno || I forget
and then || we played scrabble
oh || its || our house || very || cool
what do you think || you || maybe || want to || do
no || xxx || you know || that || that president || that || that || thought wars || were || good
oh
what would || you like || to || do with || Roman || and Sophie
no || we || did not
a litter || box
and || what color || do || we need || for || the chimney
I can || try || to || do || it || with || big peoples || ones || too || I will || try || to || do || it || with || big || people || too
I dunno
yeah
well || why || dont || you tell her || about || all || the || cool || games
alright || thank || you || very much
not sure || you used || to || sometimes || say || you wanted || to be || an astronaut
mm || play Shoots || and Ladders
that was || what
Ill || use gold || for || a chimney
okay lets || say || its || like || two weeks || later
play || what
that || thought wars || were || good || you || now || that president || that || thought wars || were || good || and || I || made || that one || and || and || I think || that || other || president || too
no || you explain
okay || its || gonna be || a gold chimney
me || okay
Shoots || and Ladders
yes
yeah
you wanna || try || it || with || big peoples || what
I call || you || up
play Shoots || and Ladders
that would be || cool || huh
we played || we played || pin
hello hello
here || Im gonna || color || some smoke
um || sometimes || you used || to say || you wanted || to be || a doctor || or || a veterinarian
yes || thats || a very || fun || game || definitely || a fun || game
pin || the || tail || on || the donkey
bowling
yes
to go || bowling || yeah || because || thats || the thing || on Sunday afternoons || they have || little pins
hm || what color || do you think smoke || would be
are || you || the || one || who sold || me || those || dinosaurs
pin || the tail || on || the donkey
anything else
yeah || so || I could || maybe || would || bring || Sammy || and Scotty || over
you made || the || one || that || thought wars || were || good || you mean Bush || our president || now || that was || the || one || that || thought wars || were || good
now || you know || what || shes || from Iceland || so || she doesnt || even || probably || know || how || to play || pin || the tail || on || the donkey || can || we || tell her || how || to play || the game
xxx Candy || Land
yes
it || would be gray || or || black smoke
I cant deal || with || them || anymore
or || I think || the pins || are || the same size || but || they have lighter balls || because || balls || can || be very heavy || to || throw || bowling || balls
and Candy || Land || too || yes
uh hum || you could || take care || of || our own || pets exactly || good idea
gray || oh || theres || a lot || of smoke || coming || out || of || that chimney

oh
oh
its || going || to be || fun || though || isnt || it
Ill || bring || another || dinosaur

that would be || good
oh || that reminds || me || though
