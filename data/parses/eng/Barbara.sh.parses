and || from || there || down || those || aye || thats
look
that || was part || of || her fringe || at || one || time
but || just letting
well || thats || just || Im letting || it grow || down || because
look
aye || I see
yeah || och || yousee || you can || put || that || in
och || look at || that
I cant || do || that || Cathy || get || a bobble
all || I || do
xxx || she wont || keep || them || in
but || if || you put || a plait || in || it || they || cant || get || it || out || as easy
but || its || not || long || enough || yet || to plait
its || not || long || enough yet
do you know || Mummy || xxx
and || Ive || had || the wee bands || like || you have

and || itll grow || down || quick || Cathy
itll || be worth || it
well || if || I got || the two || or || three inches || off || the back || at || the moment || it || would || come || up || to meet || the sides
well || I would || do || that
but || Im reluctant || to get || to || cut
because || I have || it || has || taken || me || so || long || to get || it
and || she looks || like || a || girl || now || she has || longer || hair
and || she loves
every || time || you || look at || her || shes || doing || this || like
