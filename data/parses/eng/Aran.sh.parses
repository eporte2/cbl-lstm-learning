when || you took || my || pond || off || me
there || we are
that man || driving || the tractor || is || the vet

two pounds || in || money
I could
two cameras
you want || that || on || the top || do || you
I am fixing || it
it was || a magic || story || wasnt || it || about || the jungle || and || about || the animals
you cant || shoot || my || eggs

thats || too || dangerous
you can || get || out || and || have || a look at || it || if || you want || to
youre || not || wearing || your shorts || yet || are you

I think || I || can || get cheaper || than || that || at Sainsburys
when || you land || on || a snake || you || gotto || go || down
there || it || is
far || too || dangerous
well || I should imagine || one of || the other || little boys || built || it
and || does || the soap || hurt || him
I cried || when || Mummy || took || my || pond || off || me || last week
youve gotto || say || to || me || what are you doing

it was || this morning || that
hm
leave || your hair || alone
I think || hes || a bit too thin || actually
